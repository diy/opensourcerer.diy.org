# Challenge: Clone a Repo in Bash

#Help us Write a Story
DIY has a repo with a story in it, we need everyone to help complete the story by adding parts to it.

## Cloning
You need a forked file to clone so make sure you've completed the earlier [challenge on forking](/challenge/4). The fork we created is a remote (like a far away remote island) copy stored on GitHub.com but we want the files on our computer, so we need to **clone** (aka copy) them onto our computer. Files are on your computer are considered **local** - they're much closer than files stored on servers who-knows-where, right?! Our clone will be linked to our fork which is linked to the DIY original.

### Open Bash
Open a new window in bash, or if all you've done is set up git from earlier, you're fine to use the same window.

### Navigate to Folder
We want to use Bash to move into a folder we want to clone (copy) into. Bash starts us at the root of our computer's files.

To move to another folder, we need to *change directories* or **cd**. 

In Macs type:

    cd Documents
    
In Windows type:

    cd My\ Documents/
    
*The slashes let Bash know that there is a space between 'My' and 'Documents'*

Now we're inside the Documents folder, let's put the DIY open-sourcerer repo in it!

### Clone the Repo
We want to tell Git to go to the place where GitHub.com is remotely storing our forked files and clone them to where we are right now inside of the Documents folder on our computer. Each repo on GitHub.com has an address for its location. You'll see it following the HTTP and SSH buttons near the top middle of the page. Click on HTTP, this is the address you'll use. *You'll also need to type your Github username and password*.

    git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/open-sourcerer.git

Watch as it copies the files! It will also create a folder for you with the name of the repo. When it's done cloning, move into the repo's folder:

    cd open-sourcerer

Now we're inside our very own copy of the files. Let's use **ls** to *list* the contents of this folder to see what we've got!

    ls

You should see a list of filenames that look exactly like the files you see on the website for both DIY and your account page.
