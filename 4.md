# Challenge: Install Git

## Using Git and Bash
So far, all of our files are on Github.com. We're going to be copying files from there and onto our computer so that we can make changes to them. We'll then send them back to Github so that the changes we make are available to everyone. To do all of this, we'll use **Git**, which keeps track of changes in files, and **Bash**, which allows us to issue commands. With these tools we can tell our computer, Git and GitHub what to do with the files. 

### Install Git
*A few of the steps may require your computer's password if one is set*

1. Visit [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com) and download the latest version for your operating system.
* In Mac, you won't notice anything or see the application installed, but it will install on your computer.
* In Windows, hit `Ok` or `Next` for all options, then finish (you don't have to review notes).

### Use Bash

In Mac you've already got Bash. If you go to your `Launchpad` and search for `Terminal`, this is the application you'll use.

In Windows you got Bash when you installed Git. Go to `Programs` > `Git` and select `Git Bash`.

We'll refer to both Mac's *Terminal* and Window's *Git Bash* as just *Bash*.

Let's check our Git. In the Bash window type:

    git --version

You should have been returned a line with the version number, this means that git was correctly installed and is up and running!

### Configure Git
We need to tell Git who we are so that when we move files around it knows who is moving them. Type the following lines one at a time into Bash and inside of the quotations add the email you signed up to GitHub with and your GitHub username.

    git config --global user.email "yourGitHub@email.com"
    git config --global user.name "yourGitHubusername"
