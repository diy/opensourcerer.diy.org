# Challenge: Make a GitHub Account and Create a Repo

## Make a GitHub Account
Visit [www.GitHub.com](http://www.GitHub.com) and sign up for a free account (you'll need an email address to create an account). 

### Exploring GitHub
Since you've just joined GitHub, there won't be much on your account page. Let's have a look at DIY's page. Go to [www.GitHub.com/diy](www.GitHub.com/diy). 

*screencast - repository, users, organizations, forks, explore page, octocat.*

Parts of the page:

1. **Organization** Companies and organizations have accounts on GitHub to keep their projects together.
1. **Members** Are the GitHub users that contribute to an organizations projects. They are sometimes employees or others close to the organization. 
3. **Repository** These are projects on GitHub, they contain all the project's instructions and files. Often people say "repo," short for repository. Public repos are open source! 

On pages that list repos such as an organization's page, you can quickly see the language used in the repo, the number of favorites the repo has and how many people have forked a copy of the repo (we'll talk more about forking later).

### Explore the Repo
Go to [GitHubub.com/diy](http://github.com/diy) and click the repo called [open-sourcerer](http://www.GitHub.com/diy/open-sourcerer). Now you're on the page for this repo. You can see the files inside the repo, the readme.md gives you instructions for using the project and you can see when changes have been made to the files, these are called *commits*.

##Create a Repo
To create a new repo, from your account page:

![click new repo](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/click-repo.png "click new repo icon")

1. Click the new reop button near the top left of your menu
2. Give your repo a name and short description
3. Keep 'Pubic' selected
4. Check to initialize with a README
5. Click `Create Repository`

Awesome! Now you've created your very own repo. 

##Edit a File
You can actually edit files right in GitHub.com! Click the linked blue filename, README.md. Next, click `Edit`.

You've now got a text box that you can type directly into. Once you've made changes, add a short `commit summary` this is your **commit message** that summarizes the changes you've made. Then click `commit changes`!
