Did you know, [Mojang](https://github.com/Mojang) who make Minecraft are on GitHub, too? So are [Facebook](http://www.github.com/facebook) and [Twitter](http://www.github.com/twitter) and a lot more places you might not realize have open source work on Github. GitHub has a cool mascot, Octocat, check out all the [personalities](http://octodex.GitHub.com/)!

Use the other resources on the [Open Sourcerer Skill](http://www.diy.org/skills/opensourcerer) page and find more open source projects!
