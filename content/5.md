# Push Changes in Bash
Let's add our part to the story and turn it in! We can also open up a file from Bash. Type:

    open collaborative-story.txt

It should open up the file in your computer's text editor. Add your own portion of the story after the last sentence.

When you're done, save the file. Make sure you keep it saved as a .txt file. 

### Push Changes
Now we'll **push** (aka add) our changes to our forked copy and then submit them to be added to the DIY original file. 

Return to Bash and let's check what changes we've made. Type:

    git status
 
![git status](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-status.png)

This shows you what files you've made changes to - it should say `collaborative-story.txt`. Let's see the *difference* before and after our changes with **diff**. 

    git diff
  
![git diff](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-diff.png)

You'll see a plus and minus sign showing the before and after. Press `Q` to exit the diff. 

###Add Changes
Let's tell Git what files we want to add, what our message about our changes is, and push those changes to our fork.

![git status add commit push](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/git-status-add-commit-push.png)

Start by adding your changed file:

    git add collaborative-story.txt
    

### Commit Changes
Now we'll add a *message* describing our changes and attach that to our addition.

    git commit -m "your description of changes"

### Push Changes to our Fork
Now, finally, we'll actually push the file and message to our fork on GitHub.com. Remember our fork's name is *origin* (it's our original file) and the branch is *master*.

    git push origin master
