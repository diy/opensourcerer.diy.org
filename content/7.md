Github makes it easy to let the repo author know when you've found a mistake or have an idea for a new feature. All you need to do is go to a repo's page on Github.com and click the `Issue` button then `New Issue`. Just fill out the boxes with what the issue and click `Submit new Issue`. That's it!

This gude is open and on GitHub at [github.com/diy/satellite-pages](http://github.com/diy/satellite-pages). We'd love your feedback on how we can improve it - now that you've got a Github account, submit an issue. If you can't think of anything you'd like to see changed, just say hi!
