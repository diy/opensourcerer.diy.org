# Fork a Repo
 
When you create a copy of a repo created by someone else it's called a **fork**. It's a **remote** copy, meaning the files are stored on GitHub.com and it stays linked to the original repo we copied it from. 

1. If you're not already there, go to [GitHub.com/diy](http://github.com/diy) and click on the repo [Open-Sourcerer](https://github.com/diy/open-sourcerer).
2. Near the top right, click `Fork`. Check out that animation! This means we're creating a linked copy of the code onto our account.
